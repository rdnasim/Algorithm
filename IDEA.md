  * Two months to learn from scratch is difficult. Two months is enough to brush up or revise the concepts. One can achieve this if follow a strict schedule of 60 days

    * Day 1–4: learn and implement stack, single linked list, double linked list. Also, learn how to calculate time complexities.
    * Day 5–10: Learn and implement sorting and searching Algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, count sort, binary search. Understand their time complexities in worst case , best case , average case and when these cases will occur.
    * Day 11–16: Learn and implement Trees and Heap. Binary search tree it's traversal (BFS and DFS), insertion, deletion,etc. In heap learn heap sort, priority queues.
    * Day 17–20: Learn and implement Graphs. Learn different concepts in graph such as directed, undirected, joint or disjoint.
    * Day 18–22: Learn Greedy algorithms such as coin exchange problem, Kanpsack, Kruskal, Prims.
    * Day 23–25: Learn divide and conquer algorithms: Maximum Subarray, Multiply two polynomials. Note: quick sort, merge sort, binary search are also divide and conquer Algorithms.
    * Day 26–29: Learn about graph algorithms such as Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd, Warshall's Algorithm
    * Day 30–35: Learn Dynamic Programming ( solving subproblems + Memorization). Solve Traveling Salesman Problem, Coin exchange problem (dynamic programming), and other DP problem

    Remaining 25 days practice competitive coding questions from geekforgeeks important topics such as Binary search tree, Graph( BFS and DFS), Dynamic Programming, Divide and conquer, quick sort, binary search, etc

 * Figure out a programming language to practice the above mentioned, (most likely c/c++/java/python). Get a good flavour of the language by practising the initial topics as good as possible(for this, follow a book or any website. my recommendation[1] (book for java, in fact this series may help you)) this should take a couple of weeks
    Now, go for data structures and algorithms choose one among these[2] [3] [4] .. spend a good amount of time here about 3 weeks
    now go for these[5] [6] [7] all or one by one
    At the end of the day practice is the one which can make you stand unique among others. More the time you spend practicing clearer the things will be. no shortcut.. good luck
